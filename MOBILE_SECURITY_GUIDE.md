# LUSH MILK Mobile Security Guide

This document provides guidelines and best practices for securely testing and deploying the LUSH MILK application on Android mobile devices. It outlines the security features implemented in the application and provides recommendations for developers and testers.

## Implemented Security Features

### 1. Secure Authentication

- **Encrypted Token Storage**: Authentication tokens are encrypted before being stored in local storage.
- **Session Management**: Auto-logout after configurable period of inactivity (default: 30 minutes).
- **Secure Login**: All authentication is handled via HTTPS through Supabase Auth.

### 2. Data Protection

- **Local Encryption**: Sensitive data stored on the device is encrypted using AES-256.
- **Secure Communication**: All API requests use HTTPS with certificate validation.
- **Content Security Policy**: A strict CSP is implemented to prevent XSS and other injection attacks.
- **Input Validation**: All user inputs are validated both client-side and server-side.

### 3. Payment Security

- **PCI Compliance**: Payment information is never stored on the device.
- **Tokenization**: Credit card information is tokenized before being transmitted.
- **Masked Display**: Only the last 4 digits of card numbers are displayed in the UI.

### 4. Android-Specific Protections

- **Root Detection**: Basic root detection mechanism to identify potentially compromised devices.
- **Screen Security**: Screenshots are disabled for sensitive screens.
- **WebView Hardening**: Our WebView implementation follows Android security best practices.

## Testing Guidelines

### Before Testing

1. **Use Clean Test Devices**: Preferably use devices that haven't been rooted or modified.
2. **Update OS and WebView**: Ensure devices have the latest Android OS and WebView updates.
3. **Install Required Tools**: Install tools needed for testing (e.g., Charles Proxy for HTTPS inspection if needed).

### During Testing

1. **Test Authentication Flows**:
   - Verify session expiration works as expected
   - Test login failure scenarios and error messages
   - Verify account recovery processes

2. **Data Security Testing**:
   - Verify sensitive data isn't exposed in logs
   - Check that local storage encryption is working
   - Test offline behavior with cached data

3. **Payment Flow Testing**:
   - Verify payment data is properly masked
   - Test the complete payment workflow with test cards
   - Verify payment receipts and confirmations

4. **Network Security Testing**:
   - Test with airplane mode/poor connectivity
   - Verify certificate pinning (app should reject invalid certs)
   - Check API error handling

5. **UI Security Testing**:
   - Verify sensitive fields are properly masked
   - Test copy/paste restrictions on sensitive data
   - Check for information leakage in task switcher

### Security Testing Checklist

- [ ] Authentication works correctly over different network conditions
- [ ] Session timeout correctly logs out inactive users
- [ ] Sensitive data is properly encrypted in local storage
- [ ] API requests properly handle and report errors
- [ ] Input validation prevents malformed data submissions
- [ ] Payment flows properly protect card data
- [ ] The app properly handles being backgrounded during sensitive operations
- [ ] Root detection identifies compromised devices

## Known Limitations

- **Root Detection**: Our current root detection is basic and can be bypassed by sophisticated users. This is acceptable for our current security posture but may need enhancement for high-security operations.
- **Local Storage**: While we encrypt sensitive data in local storage, a truly secure solution would use Android's KeyStore system in a native implementation.
- **WebView Limitations**: As a web application in a WebView, we have some limitations compared to native apps, particularly around secure storage.

## Reporting Security Issues

If you identify any security vulnerabilities during testing, please:

1. Document the issue with clear reproduction steps
2. Classify the severity (critical, high, medium, low)
3. Report immediately to the security team at security@lushmilk.in
4. Do not share security vulnerabilities on public channels or issue trackers

## Future Enhancements

For future releases, we plan to implement:

- Biometric authentication support
- Certificate pinning in WebView
- Offline encrypted database for improved performance
- App integrity verification
- Enhanced root detection
