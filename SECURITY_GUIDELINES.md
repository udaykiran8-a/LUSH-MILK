# Security Guidelines for LUSH MILK Application Developers

## Overview

This document outlines security best practices for developers working on the LUSH MILK application. Following these guidelines will help ensure that the application remains secure and that customer data is protected.

## Authentication & Authorization

- **Never store passwords in plain text** - Always use Supabase Auth for user authentication.
- **Use strong password policies** - Enforce password complexity requirements using the `isStrongPassword` validator.
- **Implement proper access controls** - Use Row Level Security (RLS) policies in Supabase to restrict data access.
- **Validate user sessions** - Use the `validateServerSession` utility for server-side authentication checks.
- **Avoid hardcoded credentials** - Never store API keys, tokens or other sensitive data in the code.

## Data Validation & Sanitization

- **Validate all user inputs** - Use the validation utilities in `src/lib/validators.ts` to verify user inputs.
- **Sanitize data** - Use the `sanitizeInput` function to prevent XSS attacks by escaping HTML characters.
- **Verify data on the server** - Client-side validation is convenient but must be backed by server-side validation.
- **Use TypeScript** - Leverage TypeScript's type system to catch potential issues at compile time.

## API Security

- **Implement rate limiting** - Use the rate limiters in `src/lib/rate-limiter.ts` to prevent abuse.
- **Set up proper CORS** - Only allow API requests from trusted origins.
- **Use secure HTTP headers** - The application implements security headers in `middleware.ts` - don't disable them.
- **Validate request parameters** - Check all incoming data for validity before processing.

## Database Security

- **Use prepared statements** - Supabase handles parameterization, but be careful if writing custom SQL.
- **Implement Row Level Security** - Define RLS policies to restrict data access at the database level.
- **Limit permissions** - Use the principle of least privilege for database access.
- **Encrypt sensitive data** - Use encryption for particularly sensitive customer information.

## Error Handling

- **Don't expose sensitive information** - Ensure error messages don't reveal implementation details.
- **Log securely** - Never log sensitive data like passwords, tokens, or personal information.
- **Use try/catch** - Handle exceptions properly to prevent application crashes.
- **Implement graceful degradation** - The application should function (with reduced capabilities) even when services fail.

## Dependency Management

- **Keep dependencies updated** - Regularly run `npm audit` and update vulnerable packages.
- **Minimize dependencies** - Only include necessary packages to reduce attack surface.
- **Review code changes** - Review dependency updates for unexpected changes.
- **Use dependency scanning** - Run `npm run security-check` before deploying.

## Secure Development Process

- **Run the security check script** - Execute `npm run security-check` before committing code.
- **Code reviews** - All code should be reviewed by another developer before merging.
- **Security testing** - Regularly test the application for security vulnerabilities.
- **Stay informed** - Keep up with security best practices and new threats.

## Deployment & Infrastructure

- **Use HTTPS everywhere** - All production traffic must use HTTPS.
- **Protect environment variables** - Ensure `.env` files are not committed to the repo.
- **Set up automated backups** - Configure regular database backups.
- **Implement monitoring** - Set up alerts for suspicious activities.

## Payment Processing

- **Use PCI-compliant services** - Never handle credit card information directly.
- **Validate payment data** - Use the `isValidCreditCard` utility for basic validation.
- **Secure checkout flow** - Ensure the checkout process is protected against tampering.
- **Log payment attempts** - Maintain an audit trail of payment-related activities.

## Reporting Security Issues

If you discover a security vulnerability in the LUSH MILK application:

1. **Do not disclose publicly** - Security issues should be handled confidentially.
2. **Report immediately** - Contact the security team at security@lushmilk.example.com.
3. **Provide details** - Include steps to reproduce, potential impact, and any suggested fixes.
4. **Allow time for response** - Give the team time to investigate and address the issue.

## Pre-Deployment Security Checklist

Before deploying to production, ensure:

- [x] All environment variables are properly set
- [x] Security headers are implemented
- [x] No sensitive data is hardcoded

- [x] Rate limiting is properly configured
- [x] Database RLS policies are in place
- [x] Input validation is implemented
- [x] Error handling is secure
- [x] Authentication flow is secure
- [x] Payment processing is secure
