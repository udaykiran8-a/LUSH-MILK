| Environment separation | ✅ Implemented | - | Different build scripts for dev/prod environments |
| Secret management | ⚠️ Improvement Needed | Medium | Consider using a secrets manager service |
| Configuration validation | ❌ Missing | Medium | Add validation of required environment variables on startup |

### Dependency Management

| Finding | Status | Severity | Recommendation |
|---------|--------|----------|----------------|
| Security auditing | ✅ Implemented | - | Using npm audit for dependency security |
| Dependency vulnerabilities | ⚠️ Review Needed | Medium | Regular updates needed for dependencies |
| Use of crypto-js | ⚠️ Concern | Medium | Evaluate if crypto-js is being used securely |
| Dependency lock files | ✅ Implemented | - | Package lock file is used |

### Payment Processing

| Finding | Status | Severity | Recommendation |
|---------|--------|----------|----------------|
| Payment credentials | ✅ Implemented | - | Using environment variables for payment credentials |
| Payment data handling | ⚠️ Improvement Needed | High | Ensure PCI-DSS compliance for payment data |
| Payment validation | ⚠️ Improvement Needed | Medium | Add additional payment validation |
| Payment error handling | ✅ Implemented | - | Proper error handling for payment processing |

### Frontend Security

| Finding | Status | Severity | Recommendation |
|---------|--------|----------|----------------|
| Form validation | ✅ Implemented | - | Form validation using zod and react-hook-form |
| XSS protection | ⚠️ Improvement Needed | High | Add additional XSS protection measures |
| Sensitive data exposure | ⚠️ Improvement Needed | Medium | Avoid storing sensitive data in local storage |
| Security tokens | ✅ Implemented | - | Using useRef for security tokens to avoid state storage |

## Remediation Plan

### High Priority
1. Implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)
2. Set up automated database backups
3. Implement Content Security Policy (CSP)
4. Add CSRF protection for form submissions
5. Ensure PCI-DSS compliance for payment data handling

### Medium Priority
1. Strengthen password policies
2. Implement secure account recovery flow
3. Add more comprehensive input validation
4. Implement security headers (CSP, HSTS, etc.)
5. Consider using a secrets manager service
6. Validate required environment variables on startup
7. Regularly update dependencies
8. Add additional payment validation
9. Enhance XSS protection
10. Avoid storing sensitive data in local storage

### Low Priority
1. Add documentation for security features
2. Implement security logging
3. Add automated security scanning to CI/CD pipeline

## Conclusion

The LUSH MILK application has implemented several key security features, particularly in the areas of authentication, database security, and environment configuration. However, there are significant opportunities for improvement in critical security areas such as multi-factor authentication, content security policy, CSRF protection, and payment data handling.

By addressing the recommendations in the remediation plan, especially the high-priority items, the application's security posture can be significantly strengthened to better protect user data and system integrity.

## Next Steps

1. Address high-priority security issues immediately
2. Develop a timeline for implementing medium and low-priority recommendations
3. Establish a regular security review process
4. Implement security training for the development team
5. Consider engaging with a third-party security firm for a comprehensive penetration test
