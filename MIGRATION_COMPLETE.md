   - ✅ Updated all README files and guides with the new domain
   - ✅ Created `DOMAIN_VERIFICATION.md` with a verification checklist
   - ✅ Created `INTEGRATION_VERIFICATION.md` with comprehensive testing guide

6. **Verification Tools**
   - ✅ Created integration verification script for automated testing
   - ✅ Added npm script for running the verification: `npm run verify-integration`

### Required Manual Verification

While automated scripts can verify many aspects of the migration, the following items require manual testing:

1. **Android Application Testing**
   - Install the app on a test device
   - Verify deep linking works with `lushmilk.in` URLs
   - Test certificate pinning with the production server
   - Verify network security configuration is correct

2. **Email Flow Testing**
   - Test account creation and welcome emails
   - Test password reset flow with the new domain
   - Verify marketing emails have correct links and branding

3. **Authentication Flow**
   - Test login and registration
   - Verify social login redirects use the new domain
   - Check that session management works correctly

4. **UI/UX Verification**
   - Check all pages for any remaining references to the old domain
   - Verify all links in the application point to the new domain
   - Test all forms and ensure they submit to the correct endpoints

### Environment Requirements

For the application to work correctly with the new domain, ensure:

1. **SSL Certificates**
   - Valid SSL certificate for `lushmilk.in` is installed
   - Certificate pins in the Android configuration match the actual certificate

2. **DNS Configuration**
   - DNS records for `lushmilk.in` are properly configured
   - Optional redirect from old domain to new domain is set up

3. **API Gateway/Backend**
   - Backend services accept requests from the new domain
   - CORS is configured to allow the new domain

### How to Run Verification

Run the following command to execute automated integration verification:

```bash
npm run verify-integration
```

This script will check:
- Supabase connection
- Database services integration
- Email service configuration
- Domain configuration in the database

### Known Issues

1. The TypeScript linter shows errors in some files, which are unrelated to the domain migration and should be addressed in a separate task.

2. Edge Function compatibility with the local development setup might be limited, so those features should be tested in the staging environment.

For a complete list of verification items, refer to `INTEGRATION_VERIFICATION.md`.
