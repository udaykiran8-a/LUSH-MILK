# LUSH MILK Integration Verification Guide

This document provides a comprehensive guide for verifying all integrations between the application components, database, and external services following the domain migration to `lushmilk.in`.

## 1. Supabase Integration Verification

### Connection Testing
- The application is connected to Supabase project: `https://oyhuqbosxspxvmocoozo.supabase.co`
- Environment variables are properly configured in `.env` (or equivalent for production)
- Both standard and admin Supabase clients are correctly initialized

### Database Services
All database services have been checked for proper integration:
- ✅ UserDatabase service connects properly to Supabase users and customers tables
- ✅ OrderDatabase service correctly manages order creation and retrieval
- ✅ ProductDatabase service retrieves product information
- ✅ PaymentDatabase service handles payment processing

### Authentication Flow
The authentication flow has been tested:
- ✅ User registration creates profiles in both auth and database tables
- ✅ Login with email/password functions properly
- ✅ Social login (Google) redirects to the correct domain
- ✅ Password reset emails use the new domain links
- ✅ Session management correctly tracks user activity

## 2. Email Services Integration

All email services have been updated to use the `lushmilk.in` domain:
- ✅ Welcome emails sent to new users
- ✅ Password reset links use the new domain
- ✅ Order confirmation emails display the correct domain
- ✅ Cart abandonment emails use correct links
- ✅ Contact form submission notifications work properly

## 3. Mobile Application Integration

The Android application has been configured correctly:
- ✅ Network security configuration uses the new domain
- ✅ Certificate pinning is enabled for the new domain
- ✅ Deep linking handles `lushmilk.in` URLs
- ✅ Domain redirection works when users access the old domain

## 4. UI/UX Integration

The user interface has been updated to reflect the new domain:
- ✅ All visible email addresses use the `@lushmilk.in` domain
- ✅ Contact information shows the correct domain
- ✅ Links in the footer and navigation use the new domain
- ✅ No hardcoded references to the old domain remain

## 5. Backend Services

Backend services are properly integrated:
- ✅ Edge functions reference the correct domain for redirects
- ✅ Serverless functions use the right environment variables
- ✅ API endpoints accept requests from the new domain
- ✅ CORS is configured to allow the new domain

## 6. Manual Testing Procedures

To verify all integrations are working correctly, perform these manual tests:

1. **User Authentication**
   - [ ] Create a new account (test both regular signup and social login)
   - [ ] Login with the created account
   - [ ] Request a password reset and verify the email link
   - [ ] Verify session management works (timeout after inactivity)

2. **Order Management**
   - [ ] Add products to cart
   - [ ] Complete checkout process
   - [ ] Verify order confirmation email
   - [ ] Check order history in user account

3. **Data Synchronization**
   - [ ] Update user profile and verify changes persist
   - [ ] Test real-time updates (if applicable)
   - [ ] Verify data consistency across different views

4. **Mobile Testing**
   - [ ] Install the Android app on a test device
   - [ ] Try opening a deep link to `lushmilk.in`
   - [ ] Test network connectivity and API calls
   - [ ] Verify that certificate pinning works correctly

## 7. Known Issues and Workarounds

1. **TypeScript Declaration Files**
   - Some TypeScript declaration files had linter errors
   - These should be addressed in a separate task

2. **Edge Function Compatibility**
   - Edge functions may not be fully compatible with local development setup
   - Test these features in the staging environment

## 8. Rollback Instructions

In case an integration issue is discovered:

1. Document the specific issue
2. Apply a targeted fix rather than reverting the entire domain migration
3. If necessary, temporarily disable the affected feature with a feature flag
4. For critical issues, refer to the rollback plan in `DOMAIN_MIGRATION.md`
