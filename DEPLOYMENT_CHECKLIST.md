## Deployment Process

1. **Create deployment branch**:
   ```
   git checkout -b deploy/YYYY-MM-DD
   ```

2. **Run pre-deployment checks**:
   ```
   npm run pre-deploy
   ```

3. **Deploy to staging environment first**:
   ```
   npm run deploy:staging
   ```

4. **Verify staging deployment**:
   - Run smoke tests
   - Verify critical functionality
   - Check logs for errors

5. **Deploy to production**:
   ```
   npm run deploy:production
   ```

6. **Post-deployment verification**:
   - Verify production deployment
   - Monitor logs and error reporting
   - Test critical functionality

## Emergency Rollback

If issues are detected in production:

1. **Revert to previous version**:
   ```
   npm run rollback
   ```

2. **Verify rollback success**:
   - Check that the previous version is running
   - Verify critical functionality

3. **Document the issue** for future resolution

⚠️ **Important**: All items in this checklist should be completed and verified before proceeding with the production deployment. Issues found during this process should be addressed immediately.
