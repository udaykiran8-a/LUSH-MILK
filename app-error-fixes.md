# Fixing Children Props Errors in App.tsx

The TypeScript errors in `App.tsx` are related to missing `children` props in components like `ErrorBoundary`. Here's how to fix them:

## Error: Property 'children' is missing in type '{}'

This error occurs when a component expects a `children` prop but none is provided. The specific lines with errors are:

- Line 94: `<ErrorBoundary>`
- Line 109: `<QueryClientProvider client={queryClient}>`
- Line 114: `<TooltipProvider>`
- Line 119: `<Suspense fallback={<LoadingSpinner />}>`
- Line 133: `<ErrorBoundary>`

## Solution

1. **For `ErrorBoundary` components (lines 94 and 133):**
   
   Make sure `ErrorBoundary` has children content, even if it's just a fragment:

   ```tsx
   // Before
   <ErrorBoundary>
   </ErrorBoundary>

   // After
   <ErrorBoundary>
     {/* Your content */}
   </ErrorBoundary>
   ```

2. **For provider components like `QueryClientProvider` (line 109):**

   Check if the provider component requires a children prop in its interface. If it does, ensure you're passing children:

   ```tsx
   // Before
   <QueryClientProvider client={queryClient}>
   </QueryClientProvider>

   // After
   <QueryClientProvider client={queryClient}>
     {/* Your content */}
   </QueryClientProvider>
   ```

3. **For components like `TooltipProvider` (line 114):**

   Same as above, ensure children are passed:

   ```tsx
   <TooltipProvider>
     {/* Your content */}
   </TooltipProvider>
   ```

4. **For `Suspense` component (line 119):**

   `Suspense` requires children in addition to the fallback prop:

   ```tsx
   <Suspense fallback={<LoadingSpinner />}>
     {/* Your content */}
   </Suspense>
   ```

## Full Example Fix for App.tsx

Here's the structure of what the fixed `App` component should look like:

```tsx
const App = () => {
  return (
    <ErrorBoundary>
      {/* ErrorBoundary now has children */}
      <QueryClientProvider client={queryClient}>
        {/* QueryClientProvider now has children */}
        <BrowserRouter>
          <CartProvider>
            <TooltipProvider>
              <Suspense fallback={<LoadingSpinner />}>
                <CursorSparkle />
                <ClickAnimation />
                <Toaster position="top-right" richColors closeButton />
                <AppRoutes />
                <CookieConsent />
              </Suspense>
            </TooltipProvider>
          </CartProvider>
        </BrowserRouter>
      </QueryClientProvider>
    </ErrorBoundary>
  );
};
```

If you're still seeing errors after making these changes, it's possible that:

1. The component types themselves need to be fixed
2. The import paths are incorrect
3. There are other TypeScript configuration issues

Check the component definitions and make sure they properly define their prop types including the children prop.
