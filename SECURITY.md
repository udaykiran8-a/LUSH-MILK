- **âœ… Dependency Vulnerability Scanning**: Regular checks for vulnerabilities in dependencies.
- **âœ… Code Reviews**: Security-focused code reviews as part of the development process.
- **âœ… Error Monitoring**: Implemented proper error handling and monitoring.
- **ðŸ”„ Intrusion Detection**: Advanced intrusion detection systems to be implemented.
- **ðŸ”„ Penetration Testing**: Regular penetration testing to be scheduled.

## Admin and Management Security

- **âœ… Secure Admin Authentication**: Enhanced security for administrative accounts.
- **âœ… Role-Based Access Control**: Different access levels for different user roles.
- **âœ… Admin Action Logging**: All administrative actions are logged for audit purposes.
- **ðŸ”„ IP Restrictions**: Restrict admin access by IP address, to be implemented.

## Frontend Security

- **âœ… XSS Protection**: Protection against Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks.
- **âœ… CSRF Protection**: Cross-Site Request Forgery protection implemented.
- **âœ… Content Security Policy**: Implemented CSP to prevent unauthorized code execution.
- **âœ… Secure Cookie Configuration**: HTTP-only and secure flags set on cookies.
- **âœ… Resource Loading**: Resources loaded securely with integrity checks.

## Payment Processing Security

- **âœ… PCI Compliance**: Payment processing follows PCI DSS guidelines.
- **âœ… Tokenization**: Payment card details tokenized rather than stored directly.
- **âœ… Secure Payment Gateway**: Integration with secure, reputable payment providers.
- **âœ… Transaction Monitoring**: Monitoring for suspicious payment activities.

## Infrastructure Security
